            <p><strong>I already have my hotels booked. How do I change or cancel my bookings? What are my options for refund?</strong></p>
            <p>We are giving full-refund if your booking falls in the free cancellation time period. To check if your booking falls in the free cancellation time period, please go to Trips section on our App/ Website and claim your refund. In case your booking has crossed the free cancellation window, please contact our customer service team on our helpline number: 0124 462 8747. If your hotel check-in is not within the next 7 days, we request you to please hold off calling customer service, so we can help those travelling immediately. That said, we want to assure you that all waiver benefits offered by our hotel suppliers are being seamlessly rolled-out to our customers.</p>

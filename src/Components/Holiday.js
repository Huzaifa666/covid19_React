            <h3>Holiday Packages</h3>
            <p><strong>I have already booked a holiday package with MakeMyTrip. What do I do?</strong></p>
            <p>Due to the nationwide lockdown announced, all flights flying within India and those taking off or landing in India, between 25<sup>th</sup> March 2020 and 14<sup>th</sup> April 2020 stand suspended. Thus, for both domestic and international holiday package bookings, our airline and land partners are providing date-change options. However, cancellation waivers are not available. To protect the money you paid towards the bookings, we strongly recommend a date change.</p>
            <p>We assure you that your booking amount is safe with us and we shall reach you post 15<sup>th</sup> April 2020 to discuss the future travel itinerary with you.</p>
            <p>In case you wish to cancel your booking, charges will be applicable as per the cancellation policy rules shared at the time of booking. This is because, unfortunately, airline and land partners are extending flexibility towards date change and not cancellation.</p>      
            <p><b>In case of Visa :</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><p>Visa if already processed is going to be non-refundable, as this fee is charged by the embassy, and at the moment there is no waiver on the same.</p></li>
                <li><p>The same rule as above will apply for all visas in process (already with the embassy).</p></li>
                <li><p>Visa yet to be processed has been put on hold. We will process the same according to your revised travel dates.</p></li>
                <li><p>We are in touch with the embassies and will keep you posted if there is any change. We would like to reiterate, that we are doing our best to ensure that minimal discomfort is caused to you.</p></li>

            <Item question = {"What is coronavirus (COVID-19) and how does it spread?"} 
                answer = {<p>"COVID-19 is caused by a newly-identified virus that originated in Wuhan, China in December 2019. This virus belongs to the same family of viruses that cause the common flu and SARS. The symptoms of COVID-19 include cough, fever and shortness of breath. While most cases present mild to moderate symptoms
                that can be managed with timely and proper medical care, rare cases may result in severe respiratory
                problems, kidney failure or even death. Elderly people and individuals with pre-existing health conditions
                are more likely to be severely impacted.

                The new coronavirus is known to spread from person to person through saliva droplets expelled while coughing
                or sneezing. The virus does not remain suspended in air for too long, but can settle on objects such as
                furniture, appliances and clothing. Symptoms of the disease usually show up after 14 days of contracting the
                infection. The diagnosis of COVID-19 can only be confirmed via a laboratory test."</p>}/>

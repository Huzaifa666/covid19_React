﻿Covid-19 Guidelines:

So, given the pandemic, I as a software developer thought it best to make basic aesthetically pleasing website giving information about this world-spread disease and to keep my fellow Indians updated on the :-

• Flight Policies.
• Hotel Policies.
• More information on this pandemic
• Provided a founder’s section if in the near future…Some company might need my website 😊

Technical Specificities:
Project structure is divided into :-
• Main Component that will be rendered on the screen
• Child Components.
• Styling of the components like Tabs, Pills,  is being done by react bootstrap
• List Group, Collapse is also being built by react bootstrap.

Let me know what you guys think !!
